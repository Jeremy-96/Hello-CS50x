# Hello World 

## Introduction

I begun the course of CS50 by Harvard on edx platform and the first step is to learn C language.  
Watch the first lines of code i wrote in C.


## Note

Include standard library
``` 
<stdio.h> 
```

Include specific library to cs50 course
``` 
<cs50.h> 
```

With this library, you can use the command below :
```
get_string
```

This command prompt the user in the command line tool to enter a string *( e.g. "Charles" )*

When the program is compiled, run this.
In command line tool, you can see a message like
```
What's your name ? _
```

Enter a string like the example above
```
What's your name ? Charles _
```

And see the result in command line tool
```
Hello, Charles 
```

### Summary

To start learning this language, this is a simple and fun little program.  
On the way to the next step :soon:
